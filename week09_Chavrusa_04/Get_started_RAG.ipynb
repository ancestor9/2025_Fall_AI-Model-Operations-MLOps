            "text/markdown": "Here's a summary of the provided document on technology finance as a bulleted list:\n\n*   **Necessity of Technology Finance:**\n    *   Essential for a knowledge-based economy, as traditional growth models reliant on imitation and input expansion are reaching their limits.\n    *   Addresses market failures in financing R&D, startups, and commercialization, which suffer from high uncertainty, information asymmetry (adverse selection, moral hazard), and external economies.\n    *   Despite government intervention, a shift towards market-friendly approaches is needed, especially given the strengthening of risk management under Basel II.\n\n*   **Structure of Korea's Technology Finance Market (2010 data):**\n    *   Total size: Approx. 22.8 trillion KRW, accounting for 5.2% of SME loans.\n    *   Dominant forms: Technology Evaluation Guarantee (KODIT) at 76%, policy loans at 10%, and venture capital investments at 14%.\n    *   Indirect finance (guarantees and policy loans) constitutes 86% of the market.\n    *   Government (policy finance) overwhelmingly dominates the market with a 92:8 ratio against private capital.\n    *   Contrasts with the US, where venture capital plays a leading role.\n\n*   **Current Status and Problems of Specific Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Technology Collateral System (1997-2001):**\n        *   An early attempt to use intangible assets (IP) as collateral for loans.\n        *   Limited success due to an underdeveloped technology transaction market (difficulty in collateral recovery) and the government's high loss coverage (90%), which diluted its true collateral function.\n    *   **KODIT's Technology Evaluation Guarantee:**\n        *   The most prominent technology finance product in Korea, combining technology evaluation with guarantees.\n        *   While it has shifted to technology-based evaluations, it remains heavily reliant on government funding (90-70% guarantee ratio), making it less of a market-driven product.\n        *   KODIT's direct investments may \"crowd out\" private venture capital.\n    *   **Bank's Technology Evaluation Certificate-backed Credit Loans:**\n        *   Conceptually market-friendly, as banks extend credit based on technology evaluation certificates (from KODIT, KISTI, etc.) and bear 100% of the credit risk.\n        *   Actual adoption is low (significantly decreased after 2006) because banks are reluctant to take on full risk without robust hedging or mitigation.\n    *   **Venture Capital (VC):**\n        *   Ideal for high-risk, high-return tech finance, but Korea's VC market is stagnant, with public \"mother funds\" increasingly playing a dominant role.\n        *   Private VCs tend to avoid early-stage companies (under 3 years) due to higher risk and institutional investors' preference for stable returns from later-stage companies.\n        *   Public mother funds (K-VIC) still have insufficient early-stage investment (e.g., 30% of total investment), not fully fulfilling their market-failure correction role.\n\n*   **Strategies for Revitalizing Technology Finance (Market-Friendly Approaches):**\n    *   **Activating Bank's Technology Evaluation Certificate-backed Credit Loans:**\n        *   Introduce risk-sharing mechanisms where government/policy funds bear a portion of the credit risk (e.g., 50%+).\n        *   Develop credit derivatives (Synthetic CDOs, CDS) to allow banks to transfer/distribute credit risk to capital markets (citing Germany's KfW PROMISE program as an example).\n        *   Provide incentives to banks, such as favorable treatment in the Bank of Korea's aggregate credit ceiling loan system.\n    *   **Strengthening VC Investment:**\n        *   Increase participation from institutional investors (pension funds, corporate VCs) by relaxing regulations on their contributions to VC funds.\n        *   Promote Corporate Venture Capital (CVC), potentially through matching funds for new growth sectors.\n        *   Introduce \"Venture Lease\" (equipment financing for startups) to reduce early-stage capital burdens.\n        *   Explore credit derivatives (CDS) for VC investments to hedge risk, requiring a public entity to aggregate portfolios for scale.\n    *   **Introducing Technology Value Insurance:**\n        *   A new mechanism where technology is valued, insured, and financial institutions lend based on the insurance certificate; in case of default, the insurer pays.\n        *   Key benefit: Allows the company to retain IP even if it defaults, facilitating rehabilitation.\n        *   Requires a policy insurance institution (due to initial high risk), clear risk-sharing, and mechanisms to prevent moral hazard and double-collateralization.\n    *   **Market Revitalization through Increased Demand for Technology Evaluation:**\n        *   The current technology evaluation system is largely supply-driven and public-sector-dominated.\n        *   Need to shift focus to expand private-sector demand for evaluations (e.g., for investment, M&A, IP transactions).\n        *   Consolidate fragmented government evaluation bodies into a centralized \"Technology Evaluation Institute\" (거점기관 - Hub institution) to enhance efficiency, standardization, and trustworthiness.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Korea's technology finance market, historically government-led, needs to evolve towards market-friendly models.\n    *   Key to activation is effective risk-sharing among all market participants.\n    *   Over-reliance on KODIT guarantees should gradually decrease, with increased emphasis on venture capital and diverse financial products.\n    *   The aim is to create a virtuous cycle where diversified products and appropriate risk-sharing lead to increased demand for technology evaluation, enhancing market reliability and fostering innovation."
